# Hand wired 54key full split mechanical keyboard

To cut a long story short, I started feeling pain in my wrists and
shoulders in Dec 2014. I did some research into ergonomic keyboards,
bought a Kinesis Freestyle, got sucked into the mechanical keyboard
scene, hand wired a test [8key](http://go.alonswartz.org/8key) keyboard from switch tester, sourced
and hand wired an [Atreus](http://go.alonswartz.org/atreus), ordered an Infinity Ergodox but the wait
and delays were killing me, so I designed and built my own, codenamed
*blackhawk*.

## Design goals

- **Fully programmable** - multi-layer keymaps, mouse keys, oneshot modifiers, macros, ...
- **Full split with laptop wide separation** - most comfortable hand positioning I've found
- **Non-staggered columns** - human fingers don't move diagonally
- **Staggered rows** - human fingers have different lengths
- **Just enough keys you can reach** - no stretching, no hand movement
- **Multiple thumb keys** - pity to waste two thumbs on just one key
- **Trackpoint on home-row** - great mouse at your finger tip ([guide](https://github.com/alonswartz/trackpoint))
- **Tactile mechanical switches** - once you go mechanical, you can't go back
- **Full hand with integrated wrist rests** - mobility and tenting
- **Small, minimal and compact** - mobility
